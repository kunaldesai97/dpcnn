# k8s yaml to deploy a service:
#   1 Gateway - this is the point of control for what goes in or out of the
#     cluster
#   1 VirtualService - this opens up the logic
#
# Notes:
#
# 1. the Gateway's .spec.servers.port.number is where istio will serve the API.
#    This means that you can move the service around publically irrespective of
#    the actual implementation.
# 2. Deployment's .spec.http.match.uri & .rewrite.uri allows you to publish/implement
#    a public API path while routing to a private/legacy path.
